# SchoolEngine
ShoolEngine is a game engine utilizing C++14, SDL2 and Modern OpenGL. The engine was created by Jakob Sinclair[ME] in 2014.
The project was and still is a hobby project. I choose the name because I did alot of the code during breaks in school.
This is a personal project that you are free to use, if you're mad. This engine was mostly created for myself so alot of documentation is incomplete or missing.
The code is not so clean either. I would not recommend using it. There are better engines avaliable.
The engine is based on Ben Arnolds engine: https://www.youtube.com/user/makinggameswithben

# SchoolEngineVS
A visual studio version of the normal school engine.

#License
The code right now is under the GNU GPL V3 license.
