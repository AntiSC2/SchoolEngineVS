# SchoolEngine
ShoolEngine is a game engine utilizing C++14, SDL2 and Modern OpenGL. The engine was created by Jakob Sinclair[ME] in 2014.
The project was and still is a hobby project. I chose the name SchoolEngine, because I did alot of the code during breaks in school.
This is a personal project that you are free to use, as long as you keep the license and give me credit. This engine was mostly created for myself so alot of documentation is incomplete or missing.
The code is not so clean either. I would not recommend using it. There are better engines avaliable.
The engine is based on Ben Arnolds engine: https://www.youtube.com/user/makinggameswithben
